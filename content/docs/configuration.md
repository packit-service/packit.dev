Packit uses a configuration file in the upstream repository. The config file is written in YAML language.

You should place the file in the root of your upstream repo. Packit accepts these names:

* `.packit.yaml`
* `.packit.yml`
* `.packit.json`
* `packit.yaml`
* `packit.yml`
* `packit.json`

Both Packit-as-a-Service and packit tool use this configuration file.


## Top level keys

 Key name                  | Type            | Description
---------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------
 `specfile_path`           | string          | relative path to a spec file within the upstream repository (mandatory)
 `upstream_project_name`   | string          | name of the upstream repository (e.g. in PyPI); this is used in `%prep` section to generate an archive
 `create_pr`               | bool            | when doing a new update in Fedora dist-git, should packit create a new pull request (when set to `true`) or push directly to dist-git (defaults to `false`) -- there is an issue in Pagure API version 5.5 and below that pull requests can't be opened via API, for more info see [packit-service/packit#328](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/issues/328)
 `synced_files`            | list of strings or dicts | a list of relative paths to files in the upstream repo which are meant to be copied to dist-git during an update
 `upstream_ref`            | string          | git reference to last upstream git commit (for source-git repos)
 `downstream_package_name` | string          | name of the RPM package in Fedora
 `dist_git_namespace`      | string          | namespace in dist-git URL (defaults to "rpms")
 `dist_git_base_url`       | string          | URL of dist-git server, defaults to [https://src.fedoraproject.org/](https://src.fedoraproject.org/) (has to end with a slash)
 `create_tarball_command`  | list of strings | a command which generates upstream tarball in the root of the upstream directory (defaults to `git archive -o "{package_name}-{version}.tar.gz" --prefix "{package_name}-{version}/" HEAD`)

 `actions`                 | string | custom actions/hooks overwriting the default behavior of packit (more in [Actions](/docs/actions/))
 `jobs`                    | list of dicts   | a list of job definitions for packit service: see [below](#supported-jobs) for details
 `allowed_gpg_keys`        | list of strings | a list of gpg-key fingerprints; if specified, one of the configured keys have to sign the last commit when updating in downstream; add GitHub key (`4AEE18F83AFDEB23`) if you want to use this on code merged via GitHub web interface
 `spec_source_id`          | int or string   | Numeric ID of Source inside spec file which packit should change when setting path to the newly generated tarball, can be also full name of the macro


### Minimal sample config

This is a sample config which is meant for [packit](https://github.com/packit-service/packit) itself.

```yaml
# we have the specfile in the root of our repository
specfile_path: packit.spec
# when doing an update in Fedora, we want to copy the spec file and the config file
synced_files:
  - packit.spec
  - .packit.yaml
# packit is named packitos on PyPI b/c packit name was already taken
upstream_project_name: packitos
# yes, packit is named packit in Fedora
downstream_package_name: packit
```

### More examples of `synced_files`

```yaml
synced_files:
  # copy a file from root of the upstream repo to dist-git
  - packit.spec

  # if you copy packit.yaml downstream, you can then take advantage of
  # `sync-from-downstream` command
  - .packit.yaml

  # src: a file in root of the upstream repository
  # dest: path within the downstream repository
  - src: packit.spec
    dest: redhat/packit.spec

  # also supports globbing: copy everything from fedora-packaging folder and
  # put it to the root of the dist-git repo
  - src: fedora-packaging/*
    dest: .

  # you can specify multiple source files as well:
  - src:
    - package.spec
    - some-file
    dest: .
```

## Packit-as-a-Service

As of July 2019, packit service doesn't have any web interface, so the only way
to change its behaviour is via the config file you just read about.

When you open a pull request against your upstream repository, packit service
picks up configuration file from your pull request, not from the branch against
the PR is opened. This way, you can polish your .packit.yaml and see the
results right away. (for more info, please see [packit-service#48](https://github.com/packit-service/packit-service/issues/48))


### Packit service jobs

Once the service starts handling events of your repository, it needs to have a
clear definition of what it should do.

The tasks the packit service should do are defined in section `jobs`. The section is a list of dicts:
```yaml
jobs:
- {key: value}
- {}
```

Every job has two mandatory keys:

1. `job` - name of the job (you can imagine this as a CLI command)
2. `trigger` - what is the trigger for the job?

Every job only supports a specific set of triggers.

Jobs can also accept additional configuration in a key `metadata` which has dict as a value:
```yaml
jobs:
- job: some-job
  trigger: ran-out-of-beer
  metadata:
    key: value
```


#### Supported jobs

**copr\_build**

Create a SRPM and submit an RPM build to [Fedora COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/) build system.

Supported triggers:

* **pull_request** -- check out content of the pull request
* **release** -- check out content of the tag associated with the release

Required metadata:

* **targets** - a list of mock chroots where to build (if you navigate to
  settings of your COPR project, you'll be able able to see the list of
  available values, alternatively you can install package `mock` in Fedora and
  see the list via `ls -1 /etc/mock/`.

Optional metadata:

* **timeout** - (seconds) give up watching a build after timeout, defaults to 7200s, i.e. 2 hours
* **owner** - a namespace in COPR where the build should happen (defaults to packit)
* **project** - a name of the copr project (defaults to `"{github_namespace}-{repository_name}-{pr_id}"`)

If you want to build in your own COPR namespace, you need to [grant packit
permissions](https://docs.pagure.org/copr.copr/user_documentation.html?highlight=permissions#can-i-give-access-to-my-repo-to-my-team-mate)
to build inside. The way COPR does this right now is that we, from the packit
side, need to do a request for permissions. Please reach out to us via
user-cont-team@redhat.com and we'd be glad to help you.

**Example**

```yaml
jobs:
- job: copr_build
  trigger: pull_request
  metadata:
    targets:
      - fedora-rawhide-x86_64
      - fedora-30-x86_64
```

**sync\_from\_downstream**

Pick up a change (mass rebuild, proven packager rebuild or a fix) from Fedora
dist-git and send it to upstream repository.

Supported triggers: **commit**.

**Example**

```yaml
jobs:
- job: sync_from_downstream
  trigger: commit
```

**propose_downstream**

Land a new upstream release in Fedora. This job only makes sure the changes
happen in Fedora dist-git - no builds. The global key `create_pr` controls
whether a pull request is created or changes are pushed directly.

Supported triggers: **release**.

Optional metadata:

* **dist-git-branch** - a branch in dist-git where packit should work (defaults to `master`)

**Example**

```yaml
jobs:
- job: propose_downstream
  trigger: release
- job: propose_downstream
  trigger: release
  metadata:
    dist-git-branch: f30
```

This config would update Fedora Rawhide and Fedora 30 dist-git branches.


## User configuration file

When running packit as a tool locally, it is convenient to use a configuration
file to provide data such as API tokens. Packit respects `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
environment variable. If not set, it looks inside `~/.config/` directory.

The acceptable names are the same as for the package config:

* `.packit.yaml`
* `.packit.yml`
* `.packit.json`
* `packit.yaml`
* `packit.yml`
* `packit.json`


### Values

 Key name                     | Type            | Description
------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------
 `debug`                      | bool            | enable debug logs
 `dry_run`                    | bool            | Do not perform any remote changes (pull requests or comments)
 `fas_user`                   | string          | username in Fedora account system (to perform kinit if needed)
 `github_token`               | string          | Github API token: this is needed when packit interacts with Github API: https://github.com/settings/tokens (getting full read & write repo scope should be enough)
 `pagure_user_token`          | string          | Pagure token needed to access REST API, get it at: https://src.fedoraproject.org/settings#nav-api-tab

Specifying tokens as environment variables `GITHUB_TOKEN` and
`PAGURE_USER_TOKEN` is now deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
Please store the tokens in the config file.

Since API tokens are a very sensitive information, please do NOT ever store
them in a public (such as a GitHub repository). The configuration file here is
located on your workstation, please do NOT confuse it with a config file for
your project - that one is described above in the first section of this
document.


### Minimal sample config

```yaml
debug: true
github_token: mnbvcxz123456
pagure_user_token: qwertyuiop098765
```


#### Server-side configuration

These values are used to configure packit service. No need to bother with them, they serve as a documentation for us, packit service developers.
