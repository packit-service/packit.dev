## Week 26+27 (June 28th - July 9th)

Summer is here and vacations with it. Most of the work done in this sprint
is either internal (not user facing) or not finished yet.

- Thanks to Ma≈•ejM Packit Service now triggers a new Copr build if no
  suitable build has been found. That fixes an issue that the service sometimes
  did not react to `/packit test`.

## Week 28 (June 12th - July 16th)

- We have a new API endpoint for obtaining projects of given forge.
  ([packit-service#1159](https://github.com/packit/packit-service/pull/1159))
- The bug causing that some projects couldn't be loaded in our dashboard was fixed.
