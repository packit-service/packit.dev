Packit-as-a-Service is a [GitHub App](https://developer.github.com/apps/about-apps/)
that helps you continuously ensure that your project work in Fedora OS.

## Easy to use

Using Packit Service is very straightforward: add one [config
file](/docs/configuration/)
to your repository together with the RPM spec file and you're good to go. 

Packit Service validates your pull requests by building your software in Fedora OS.
Once the builds are done, Packit lets you know how to install the
RPMs inside your environment so you can try the changes before merging them.

Packit is also available as a [CLI tool](https://github.com/packit-service/packit/blob/master/README.md),
so you can always try things locally on your own.

### Add .packit.yaml configuration file

Packit Service expects the ".packit.yaml" configuration file in root of your upstream repository.
For more info, see
[.packit.yaml documentation](/docs/configuration/).

### Add RPM spec file

Packit Service needs the RPM spec file to build your project.

Either include it in your upstream repository or
if you do not want to have it in your upstream repository,
see section [RPM spec file not in upstream](/faq/#rpm-spec-file-not-in-upstream-repository)

### How to check Packit Service works in your project?

Currently, Packit Service is able only to build your changes and provide them as RPMs.
Once you create a pull request, Packit Service builds the code from the
pull request in COPR repository and reports back COPR build status to the pull request.

An example of Packit Service pull request:

![Packit service pull request](/packit-service-pr.png)

### How to re-trigger Packit Service actions in your pull request?

Packit Service is able to trigger a pull request comments and reacts on them.
If you want to test the pull request is still buildable by Packit Service in COPR repository,
add a comment `/packit copr-build` into your pull request
and Packit Service triggers it and builds the code from the pull request in COPR repository.

Only project collaborators can re-trigger actions.
